Main Tool:
- reads verbs from verbs.json
- reads articles from articles.json
- searches book.txt for verb occurence and capture the following word (skipping articles), if noun then adds it to report in output.json

prepare_data.py - prepares the input .txt data
sets_operations.py - enable playing with sets

For tests I have included "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy in .txt format. <br>
